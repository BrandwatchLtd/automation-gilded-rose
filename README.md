Brandwatch automation tech test

## What needs to be done?
This is small test suite to ensure that Google Shopping works as expected. Engineer started with the task, the code is incomplete and it needs a clean up. They have written some automated tests that are in an incomplete state. Not only that but the code is partially refactored to use page objects.

## What are you going on about?!
This is an opportunity to showcase your skill set.
Take a look at the code, at where it can be completed and what can be improved.
Feel free to refactor the code in any way you feel necessary.
If you have a pattern that would work better, or a better way, you have the freedom to change this code any way you see fit.

## Where should I start?
If you are not sure where to start, the engineer has written 3 tests that are green, but they didn't write the code for the last 2, these need to be completed.

## What is required?
Once your changes have been completed and submitted the code must:

- Have documentation for setup and running tests
- Run out of the box (including dependencies)
- Ensure all tests pass successfully

## Any other tips?
The main areas we will be looking at are:

- The completion of the missing tests
- The coverage of the tests
- Quality and style of code used
